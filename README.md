# Quotes-App
A simple Android app that displays a collection of motivational and philosophical quotes. The app fetches quotes from a text file stored in the assets folder and presents them in a scrollable RecyclerView. Quotes are displayed with the quote text and the author's name.

## Features

- Displays a list of quotes and authors.
- Quotes are loaded dynamically from a text file (`quotations.txt`) in the `assets` folder.
- User-friendly interface with a grid layout to display quotes.
- Handles empty lines and missing authors in the data file gracefully.
